# hybrid_centroid
Use Dependent DTW in a modified K-Medoids where each centroid is constructed/updated by more than one prototype (an existing data) that corresponds to 
a highly-associated group of features. (This is useful when a time series is constructed by several time series from different sources). 


You can find the M-RD stage 1 (grouping data sources) and M-RD stage 2 (constructing/updating hybrid centroid) in the notebook "Selecting_Rep" (see sections `Stage 1: Grouping resources` and `Stage 2: Hybrid Centroid M-RD`)

(Note: the corresponding paper is under review)
